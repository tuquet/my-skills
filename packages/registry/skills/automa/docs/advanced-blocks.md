# Advanced Blocks: Loops, Tables & Conditions

To build resilient, scalable data extraction pipelines in Automa, you must master branching (`conditions`), iteration (`loop-data`, `loop-elements`), and data management (`insert-data`, `google-sheets`).

---

## 1. Branching with Conditions (`conditions`)

The `conditions` block dynamically routes the workflow based on logical expressions. It evaluates an array of branches (e.g., `output-1`, `output-2`) from top to bottom.

### Core Mechanics
*   **First Match Wins**: The engine stops evaluating at the first branch that evaluates to `true` and routes the execution specifically to that block's output port.
*   **Logical AND**: Inside a single branch, you can have multiple items (e.g., `value` and `compare`). They are evaluated sequentially and all must pass.
*   **The Fallback Edge**: If NO conditions are met, Automa routes to the `fallback` output ID. **CRITICAL: You must always connect a block to the fallback node.** If there is no connection on the fallback port, the workflow will reach a dead-end and silently hang or crash.

### Best Practices
*   **Retry Logic**: For asynchronous checks (e.g., waiting for a dynamically rendered element to exist), utilize `retryConditions: true`, `retryCount`, and `retryTimeout` rather than instantly failing over to the fallback.
*   **Type Coercion**: Ensure you compare apples to apples by using type casting prefixes (e.g., `"number::100"`) when evaluating variables.

## 2. Iteration (Loops)

Automa manages loops through a triad of blocks, managed via a unique `loopId`. 

### `loop-data` & `loop-elements`
*   **`loop-data`**: Iterates through structured arrays (JSON data, numbers, internal table, Google Sheets rows).
*   **`loop-elements`**: Iterates through a physical NodeList of DOM elements on the active tab. It natively supports lazy-loading (pagination) via the `loadMoreAction` (scroll/click) property.

### `loop-breakpoint`
*   **Mandatory Closing Block**: Every loop branch must end with a `loop-breakpoint` block that references the same `loopId`. 
*   This block signals the engine to either `continue` (increment index and loop again) or `break` (exit the loop and clear state). 
*   **Flow Structure**: You must connect an edge *from* the `loop-breakpoint` *back* to the original `loop-data`/`loop-elements` block to physically close the loop.

### Interpolation Variables
During a loop, the engine injects state variables:
*   `{{loopData.myLoop.data}}`: Retrieves the raw value of the current iteration.
*   `{{loopData.myLoop.$index}}`: Retrieves the current iteration index (0-based).
*   `{{loopData@myLoop}}`: A special syntax used in CSS selectors during `loop-elements`. Instead of querying the whole document (`document.querySelector`), this restricts the selector context strictly to the current DOM element being iterated over (e.g., `{{loopData@myLoop}} > h2.title`).

## 3. Data Extraction Pipeline (Tables & Sheets)

Automa uses an internal **Table (Data Columns)** as a temporary database for the lifecycle of a workflow execution. 

### Inserting Data
1.  **Automatic Extraction**: Blocks like `get-text` or `attribute-value` have a `saveData: true` parameter. When enabled, you specify a `dataColumn` name, and the scraped value is instantly appended to the current row.
2.  **Explicit Insertion**: The `insert-data` block allows you to construct a completely custom row (using `{ column, value }` pairs) and append it to the table manually.

### Data Cleanup
If you need to sanitize data (e.g., stripping '$' signs or whitespace) before inserting:
*   Use `get-text` to assign the raw text to a variable (`assignVariable: true`).
*   Format the variable using `regex-variable` or `javascript-code`.
*   Finally, use `insert-data` to save the clean variable into the Table.

### Exporting & Syncing
*   **`export-data`**: Exports the internal table to disk (CSV, JSON). Enables `addBOMHeader` for Excel compatibility.
*   **`google-sheets`**: Appends or overwrites the internal table (`data-columns`) directly to a remote spreadsheet using `insertDataOption: "INSERT_ROWS"`.

### 🚨 Critical Anti-Pattern: Network Calls Inside Loops
**NEVER** place an `export-data` or `google-sheets` block *inside* your extraction loop. 
*   Doing so will fire an API call for every single row you scrape, leading to heavy rate-limiting and incredibly slow execution.
*   **Correct Pattern**: Use the loop exclusively to scrape and populate the internal Table (`insert-data`). Connect the `google-sheets` block *after* the `loop-breakpoint` exits, allowing you to bulk-upload the entire table array in one single, fast API request.

## 4. JavaScript Transformations (`javascript-code`)

The `javascript-code` block is a powerful escape hatch for when standard blocks (like `regex-variable` or `data-mapping`) aren't flexible enough. It executes within a secure Sandbox environment but provides specialized helper functions to interact with the workflow state.

### Built-in Helper Functions
*   `automaRefData(keyword, path)`: Extracts data from the workflow's state. 
    *   *Example*: `const myVar = automaRefData('variables', 'myVar');`
    *   *Example*: `const myConst = automaRefData('globalData', 'myConst');`
*   `automaSetVariable(name, value)`: Dynamically sets or overwrites a workflow variable.
    *   *Example*: `automaSetVariable('cleanPrice', 1500);`
*   `automaNextBlock(data, insert)`: Advances the workflow to the next block. 
    *   If you omit this, Automa automatically appends `automaNextBlock()` to the end of your script.
    *   *Tip*: You can pass an object to insert it directly into the table, e.g., `automaNextBlock({ price: 1500 }, true)`.

### Common Use-Case: Data Formatting
When scraping messy text, use JavaScript to clean it before inserting it into your table or passing it to an API.
```javascript
// 1. Retrieve the raw scraped variable
const rawText = automaRefData('variables', 'scraped_text');

// 2. Transform the data (e.g., extracting numbers)
const sanitized = rawText.replace(/[^0-9.]/g, '');

// 3. Save it back to a new variable
automaSetVariable('clean_price', sanitized);

// 4. Continue workflow
automaNextBlock();
```

### Interpolation (`{{ }}`) inside JS
While you can use `{{variables.xx}}` inside the JS code block, it's safer and cleaner to use `automaRefData()` to prevent syntax errors if the variable contains unexpected quotes or line breaks. Save string interpolation for UI blocks (like URLs or CSS Selectors).
